    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical text data are unstructured narratives found in medical notes, discharge summaries, and patient reports. This type of text data captures the nuanced reasoning and observations of healthcare professionals. Unlike structured tabular data, clinical text contains rich contextual information that is essential for understanding patient histories, diagnoses, and treatment plans. Leveraging machine learning to classify and interpret this text can support clinicians in identifying key conditions, streamlining documentation, and improving patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will develop a machine learning model to classify clinical notes using the **MIMIC-III dataset**. This dataset consists of de-identified clinical narratives from real hospital admissions, providing a realistic setting for exploring **natural language processing (NLP)** in healthcare. The classification task focuses on assigning diagnostic categories to free-text notes, a common challenge in automating clinical workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the MIMIC-III dataset because it is a widely recognised resource for clinical NLP research, offering diverse and authentic examples of medical documentation. Its breadth and complexity make it ideal for studying the challenges and opportunities of text-based classification in medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocess clinical text data for machine learning\n",
    "- Apply text vectorisation techniques such as **TF-IDF**\n",
    "- Train and evaluate classifiers (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**) on clinical text\n",
    "- Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices\n",
    "- Discuss the ethical and practical considerations of deploying NLP models in clinical settings\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will gain practical experience with the full workflow of clinical text classification and develop a deeper appreciation for the impact and challenges of applying NLP in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the structure of clinical free-text data\n",
    "- Learn text preprocessing and vectorisation (e.g., TF-IDF)\n",
    "- Train and evaluate a classifier on medical text\n",

    "## Additional Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Clinical Text Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical text data consists of unstructured narratives written by healthcare professionals, such as progress notes, discharge summaries, and radiology reports. Unlike structured data (e.g., lab values in tables), these free-text documents capture nuanced reasoning, observations, and patient histories that are difficult to encode in fixed fields. Clinical text is rich in context but also challenging to analyse due to abbreviations, jargon, and variability in language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In healthcare, clinical text is used for:\n",
    "- **Diagnosis documentation** (e.g., describing symptoms, findings, and impressions)\n",
    "- **Care coordination** (e.g., handoff notes between providers)\n",
    "- **Quality improvement and research** (e.g., mining notes for trends or adverse events)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Text Classification in Medicine?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world clinical tasks involve sorting or tagging text:\n",
    "- Assigning diagnostic codes to notes for billing or research\n",
    "- Flagging notes that mention critical findings (e.g., sepsis, stroke)\n",
    "- Triage and routing of patient messages or referrals\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating these tasks with machine learning can save time, reduce errors, and support clinical decision-making, but requires careful handling due to the sensitive and complex nature of medical language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Clinical NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical natural language processing (NLP) involves several foundational concepts that are essential for transforming raw clinical text into meaningful insights. Understanding these concepts helps ensure that machine learning models are both effective and reliable when applied to healthcare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and standardising text (e.g., lowercasing, removing stop words) to reduce noise and improve model performance.\n",
    "- **Vectorisation**: Converting text into numerical features (e.g., TF-IDF) so that machine learning models can process it.\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance**: Some diagnoses or findings are much rarer than others, which can bias models if not addressed.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Clinicians need to understand why a model made a particular prediction, especially in high-stakes settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use TF-IDF and Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right tools for text classification is crucial in clinical NLP. TF-IDF and logistic regression are commonly used because they balance interpretability and performance, making them suitable for initial experiments and baseline models in healthcare applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TF-IDF**: Highlights words that are important for distinguishing between classes, down-weighting common words and up-weighting rare but informative terms.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: A simple, interpretable baseline for text classification that works well with high-dimensional, sparse data like TF-IDF vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical and Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying NLP in clinical settings demands careful attention to privacy, fairness, transparency, and the potential impact of errors. Sensitive patient information in clinical notes must be securely handled and de-identified. Models should be rigorously evaluated to avoid amplifying biases and to ensure their outputs are interpretable and auditable, as errors can have serious consequences for patient care."
