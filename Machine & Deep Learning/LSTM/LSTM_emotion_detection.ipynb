        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now a major field of AI research: machine translation, text understanding, chatbots, etc. Text, speech or video are data sequences that have a dependency (temporal or contextual) that cannot be captured correctly by feed-forward networks. Text, speech or video are data sequences that have a dependency (temporal or contextual) that cannot be captured correctly by feed-forward networks. Recurrent networks (RNN) are better suited to this type of data. In particular, LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks are specialised in analysing data sequences thanks to their ability to 'remember'.\n",

        "In this tutorial, we are going to use an LSTM-based neural network to detect emotions in a text. This apparently easy task is, however, highly open to interpretation, and the emotion conveyed in a text can be anything and everything depending on the context, intention or other subjective components.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we're going to use the PyTorch library, which is particularly useful for implementing neural networks in Python. This library is not installed by default on Jupyter, so you need to download it using the following command (this can take several minutes, so please be patient). Installation is complete when the star [*] to the left of the cell disappears. As long as the star appears, the installation is not complete."
