### Introduction to causality and causal reasoning

This section covers foundations of causal graphs, probabilistic models, and causal discovery.  While correlation identifies associations between variables, causal inference seeks to answer what happens if we intervene? This shift from observation to intervention is critical in fields like medicine, economics, and artificial intelligence.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts Covered
##### 1. Causality vs. Correlation
- Describes the limitations of associational statistics.
- Demonstrates how correlation does not imply causation using simple examples.

##### 2. Counterfactual Reasoning
- Introduces the concept of counterfactuals, i.e., reasoning about "what would have happened if…"
- Provides formal notation for counterfactual queries and their use in causal reasoning.

##### 3. Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
- Formal framework proposed by Judea Pearl.
- Defines variables and relationships via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
- Encodes assumptions explicitly to model interventions and counterfactuals.

##### 4. Do-Calculus and Interventions
- Introduces the do-operator $do(X = x)$ to model interventions.
- Explains how to compute post-intervention distributions.


##### 5. Identifiability and Estimation
- Discusses when a causal quantity is identifiable from observational data.
- Introduces conditions like back-door and front-door criteria.

#### 🔄 AI Project Management Phases (Applied in Our Challenge)

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Defined the industrial need: automatic quotation of product manufacturing costs.

2. **Data Understanding**  
   Explored the provided dataset, identified gaps, and assessed quality and relevance.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   Cleaned, processed, and structured the data for modeling.

4. **Modeling**  
   Applied machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict prices.

5. **Evaluation**  
   Attempted to assess model performance based on accuracy and business relevance.

6. **Deployment Planning**  
   Proposed a basic integration plan into an industrial workflow.

7. **Monitoring & Maintenance (Theoretical)**  
   Considered how the model would need to evolve over time.

#### 🛠️ Use Case: Automatic Product Quotation System

- Designed an AI-powered tool to support **cost estimation** in a manufacturing context.
- Mapped industrial needs to data and technical requirements.
- Balanced trade-offs between **accuracy**, **interpretability**, and **feasibility**.
- Shared insights and solution architecture in a final **team presentation**.

#### 💡 Key Takeaways from the Data Challenge

- We had only **5 hours** to regroup and complete the challenge, which tested our ability to prioritize, collaborate, and make quick decisions.
- We completed most of the presentation—including project planning and system design—but couldn’t deliver a **functioning machine learning model** in time.
- Despite trying both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**, our models failed to produce reliable predictions.
- Possible reasons include:
  - Data cleaning issues
  - Bugs or missteps in our **Python implementation**
  - Misalignment between model selection and the data characteristics
- This made it clear that early alignment around **data quality and preprocessing** is critical.
- Our biggest takeaway: **if the model fails, revisit the data pipeline first**—debugging at the model stage without clean data is often wasted effort.
- Moving forward, we need to rebuild the pipeline with a stronger foundation in **data cleaning**, **model debugging**, and **performance evaluation**.

### Generative AI

This section covers fundamental theories of semantic representation in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

#### 🔍 Key Concepts Covered
##### 1. Ontology of Meaning
Semantic meaning is formally defined as the invariant truth conditions shared across paraphrased expressions, exemplified by deriving "Socrates is mortal" from "All men are mortal." This conceptual framework is implemented computationally through three complementary paradigms: symbolic logic using first-order predicate calculus (e.g., $\forall x: { } human(x) \Rightarrow mortal(x) $); vector geometry that maps words to $\mathbb{R}^D$ where angular distance quantifies semantic similarity $(e.g.,~\arccos\left( \frac{\vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2}{\lVert \vec{v}_1 \rVert \lVert \vec{v}_2 \rVert} \right))$  reveals "anteater" ($\vec{v}_1$) and "ant" ($\vec{v}_2$) are 15° apart); and neural networks that learn continuous representations $\phi: \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D$ directly from linguistic data, prioritizing scalability over interpretability.

##### 2. Componential Semantics
Lexical meaning is decomposed into atomic primitives—binary features ($man = [+male, +adult]$) for basic terms or continuous activations across 873 Larousse concepts for richer vocabulary (e.g., "peace" activates $PEACE=0.9$, $LIBERTY=0.8$). Semantic composition is governed by algebraic operations: normalized summation $\left( v_a\mathbin{\oplus_b} = \frac{v_a + v_b}{\lVert v_a + v_b \rVert} \right) $) merges primitives, term-wise product ($v_a\mathbin{\otimes_b} = v_a \odot v_b $) extracts intersections, and weak contextualization ($\gamma(v_a, v_b) = v_a + v_b + \left( v_a \odot v_b \right) $) enriches meaning. Polysemy is resolved via vector superposition, as in $bat = 0.6\cdot v_{animal} + 0.4 \cdot v_{sports{ }tool}$.

##### 3. Distributional Semantics"You understand a word by the words around it":

- Basic Approach:

  - Each word gets a unique ID (like "apple=ID73")

  - Documents become lists of these IDs


- Advanced Approach (Word2Vec):

  - Predicts neighboring words (e.g., "juice" likely near "orange")

  - Discovers relationships: king - man + woman ≈ queen

  - Groups similar words (Sweden/Norway/Denmark cluster together)

##### Evolutionary Synthesis
The trajectory progresses from interpretable handcrafted features (1960s-2000s) to data-driven statistical embeddings (2010s), culminating in hybrid deep learning models that balance precision and scalability. This convergence establishes vectors as the universal substrate for semantic computation in modern NLP systems.
