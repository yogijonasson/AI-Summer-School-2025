### Frugal AI: Social & Environmental Impact

Frugal AI refers to resource-efficient, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable approaches to AI development and deployment.

#### 🚩 Key Challenges Addressed
- High carbon footprint from large-scale AI models (e.g., LLMs)
- Social exclusion in under-resourced regions
- Misalignment between AI development and global sustainability goals

#### 📚 Connections to KTH Sustainability Readings
- **Donella Meadows – *Leverage Points***  
  - Frugal AI targets deep leverage points (e.g., shifting system goals and mindsets) to move beyond performance-focused AI.
- **Steve Easterbrook – *From Computational Thinking to Systems Thinking***  
  - Encourages viewing AI as part of complex socio-technical systems requiring holistic, interdisciplinary approaches.
- **Red AI vs. Green AI**  
  - *Red AI*: Prioritizes performance, scale, and accuracy—often ignoring energy and resource costs.  
  - *Green AI*: Focuses on efficiency, transparency, and sustainability—core to the Frugal AI approach.

#### 🧭 Core Principles
- ⚡ **Environmental Efficiency**
  - Model compression, pruning, and use of edge computing
  - Energy-efficient training and deployment processes

- 🌍 **Social Inclusion**
  - Design AI for low-resource environments and infrastructure
  - Utilize transfer learning, federated learning, and inclusive datasets

- 🧠 **Systems Thinking**
  - Evaluate AI through full life cycle assessment (LCA)
  - Consider unintended consequences and feedback loops

- 🎯 **Ethical & Sustainable Governance**
  - Align AI development with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
  - Encourage transparency, accountability, and interdisciplinary collaboration

#### 🎯 Overall Goal
> To move toward AI systems that **do more with less**, embedding sustainability, equity, and ethical responsibility as foundational—not optional—values in innovation.
